# Stepper

Stepper is a tiny [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin. This came about when looking for some help in developing a wizardy interface and it ended up being a good fit***. Basically it assigns a bunch of events which allow you to control focus in an ordered sequence of elements. Along the way there are classnames to help you style these elements to your heart's content. Maybe you'll find a use for it in a wizard interface too, or a slideshow,  or JS-based presentation software... who knows? :)

There's a simple example in example.html. There's another example in another_example.html.

This is currently using jQuery 1.4.2.

*** I've kept this plugin really brief. When I used it in production I put together quite a bit of wrapper code which used this beneath. I might end up including some of that extra stuff in the plugin, but for now this is the core of it.
