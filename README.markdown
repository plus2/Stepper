# Stepper

Stepper is a tiny [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin. This came about when looking for some help in developing a wizardy interface and it ended up being a good fit. Basically it assigns a bunch of events which allow you to control focus in an ordered sequence of elements. Along the way there are classnames to help you style these elements to your heart's content. Maybe you'll find a use for it in a wizard interface too, or a slideshow,  or JS-based presentation software... who knows? :)

There's a simple example in example.html. There's another example in another_example.html.

This is currently using jQuery 1.4.2.
